# Goal

- Create an Employee Table like the one in the image below.
- Use any front-end framework (Angular, React, Vue, ect...) or CSS library to accomplish this.
- Implement the back-end API with a Node.js framework, and a NoSQL database

# Functional Requirements

- Initially, list all employees that are in data.json
  - First name, last name, and salary in currency format (ie. $42,000)
- The ability to edit an employee
- The ability to delete an employee
- The ability to create a new employee

# Technical Guidelines

- Structure your application and components in a modular/reusable way
- Commit code with useful and informative comments
- Your application doesn't have to use the data.json file directly, but have a SQL script to initialize your database with data found in that file
- Implement API code to read and write to a SQL database
- Styling: CSS or SCSS or SASS can be used, whichever you prefer (can use popular UI frameworks like Bootstrap as well)
